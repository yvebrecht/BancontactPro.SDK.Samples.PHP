# BancontactPro.SDK.Samples.PHP

> **This is not an official Bancontact project.** Independent samples for the unofficial [BancontactPro.SDK](https://github.com/yvebrecht/BancontactPro.SDK) libraries.

A small web UI over the PHP client, to try a payment by hand against Bancontact's preprod with the Bancontact Pay test app,
and to see what goes over the wire while you do. It runs on PHP's built-in server with no framework and is meant to run
**locally**: it listens on `localhost` only and has no login, because it calls Bancontact with your credentials.

The package is not published yet, so the sample installs the sister folder: clone `BancontactPro.PHP` next to this repo
(`composer.json` has a `path` repository `../BancontactPro.PHP`). Once published, that becomes a normal requirement.

## Pages

| Page | What it does |
|---|---|
| Status | Environment, which products have credentials, the callback URL. |
| Payment | Creates a payment (or a Static QR payment with a POS ID), shows the QR code and deeplink, follows the status every 2 s and from callbacks, cancels. The debug panel below follows that payment. |
| QR test | Builds the self-made payload URLs (`/t/1/{PPID}` and `/l/1/{PPID}/{POSId}`) and the generator image, without an API call. Scan with the preprod test app. |
| Callbacks | The verified callbacks Bancontact sent to `POST /bancontact/callback`. |
| Debug | Everything below, unfiltered. |

## Debug information

Every call the library makes to Bancontact and every callback goes into the debug log:

- request: method, URL, headers (the `Authorization` API key is masked to its last 4 characters; the `Signature` header is shown), body;
- response: status, headers, body, duration; for errors the `traceId` and `spanId` that Bancontact support asks for;
- callback: all received headers (including `Signature`), the exact body, and the verification result. A rejected callback shows the reason;
- the JWKS fetches of the callback verifier appear as requests too.

This works through a PSR-18 decorator (`src/DebugHttpClient.php`) around the Guzzle client that is passed to `ClientFactory`. The library adds
the `Authorization` and `Signature` headers before it calls the client, so the log shows the request as it was sent.

PHP serves every request in a fresh process, so the debug log and the received callbacks are kept in JSON files under `var/` (git-ignored).

## Run

Needs PHP 8.2 or later with `ext-openssl`, and Composer. If PHP is not installed locally, use Docker (the `composer:2` image has both).

```bash
composer install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in the API key and PPID of each product you want to try
php -S localhost:5087 -t public public/index.php
```

Open http://localhost:5087. The environment is `Preprod` unless `BANCONTACT_ENVIRONMENT=Production`: do not point this sample at production with real money.

## Docker

The compose file pulls a prebuilt image, `ghcr.io/yvebrecht/bancontactpro-sample-web-php`, which the workflow `.github/workflows/sample-web-image.yml` builds and publishes on every push to `main`. That is what lets Portainer and other tools that cannot run a build deploy it: the build needs `BancontactPro.PHP` checked out next to this repository, which a stack cannot provide.

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in the credentials
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:5087. The port is published on `127.0.0.1` only, as the app has no login: on a server, put a reverse proxy with its own login in front of it, or set `SAMPLE_WEB_BIND` on purpose. `.env` also sets `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `SAMPLE_WEB_PORT` and `SAMPLE_WEB_IMAGE` (another tag, for example `:sha-abc1234`).

In Portainer, add a stack from this repository with the compose path `docker-compose.yml` and set the variables of `.env.example` as the stack's environment variables.

To build the image yourself, with `BancontactPro.PHP` cloned next to this repository:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up --build
```

For a step-by-step walkthrough (credentials, callbacks, a first payment, troubleshooting) see the [setup guide](docs/setting-up-the-samples.md).

## Callbacks

Bancontact must reach `POST /bancontact/callback` over public HTTPS. Start a tunnel to port 5087, set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the tunnel's address
(no trailing slash) in `.env`, and restart. The Payment page sends `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` + `/bancontact/callback` as the payment's `callbackUrl`.
Without it the callback URL is `http://localhost:5087/...`, which Bancontact cannot reach: the payment still works, you just follow it by polling.
The signature covers the request path, so the tunnel must not rewrite it. Note that PHP's built-in server handles one request at a time.
